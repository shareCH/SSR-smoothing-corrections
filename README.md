# SSR-smoothing-corrections
R Code for the article "Smoothing corrections for improving sample size recalculation rules in adaptive group sequential study designs" by Carolin Herrmann and Geraldine Rauch.



* **What the project does**: \
This is the R code used for the simulations in the manuscript "Smoothing corrections for improving sample size recalculation rules in adaptive group sequential 
study desings" by Carolin Herrmann and Geraldine Rauch.

* **Why the project is useful**: \
In the above mentioned article, smoothing corrections are presented as one possible option to counteract shortcomings of sample size recalculation rules 
like high variability in sample size and conditional power.
The smoothing corrections can be combined with existing sample size recalculation rules.

* **How users can get started with the project**: \
Download all the uploaded R-files and open "Main.R" where you can specify the parameters for the simulations.

* **Where users can get help with your project**: \
Background knowledge on the implemented theory can be found in "Smoothing corrections for improving sample size recalculation rules in adaptive group
sequential study designs" by Carolin Herrmann and Geraldine Rauch.

* **Who maintains and contributes to the project**: \
The code was written by Carolin Herrmann and Geraldine Rauch.
